## Installation

To install dependancies, run the following commands:

     ```
     `npm install` to create node_modules in client, server and root
     ```
     I made sure to delete the package-lock.json file in the root first, and downgrade react & react-dom  to 17.0.2 in the client directory.

     `npm install --save apollo-server apollo-server-core apollo-server-express graphql npm install --save-dev @types/graphql @types/express typescript` in root to install Apollo connection and grapql API
     ```
     run `mongod` to start MONGODB service in another terminal
     ```
     ```
     `npm start` to run from client directory, `npm run watch` from server directory, and `npm run develop` from the root:
     ```
     ```
     `npm i heroku` and `heroku create` to create URL of app in Heroku.com
