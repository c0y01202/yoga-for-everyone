# YOGA FOR EVERYONE:lotus_position:

### Interactive MERN SPA Project

## Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to build a collaborative, responsive and functional website using REACT. This application includes MERN stack single-page application, a scalable MongoDB back-end, a GraphQL API, and an Express.js and a Node.js server with a React front-end that implements user-authentication with JWT. The purpose of the JWT is to authenticate users to access a schedule for yoga classes. The purpose of the other links is to build a user-focused platform that allows for greater knowledge of types of yoga and access to virtual classes.

## User Story:

`"AS A yoga enthusiest I WANT an application that gives me access to studios I can attend. I WANT to be able to log in and out, and search for different yoga classes and times and locations SO THAT I can attend upcoming yoga events. As a user I also want to be able to access information on types of yoga and have access to virtual classes that I can pay for in the case that I cannot be at the yoga studio physically."`
